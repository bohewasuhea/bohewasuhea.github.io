Recommendations for watching anime you can. There are many different types of anime that can be enjoyed, so it really depends on what you're looking for in an anime. While there are some general tips that apply to all types of Anime, here are some specific recommendations for those who enjoy the genre of Anime: 
-Watching a new show immediately after its release is always a great way to start an AnimeWalker day. This will give you a sense of when the next episode will air and provide you with a recap of the story before you even get started watching. 
-If you're looking for something more drawn out, try checking out OVA's or one-shots before getting into the full series. These episodes usually have less action and more atmosphere, which can add to your enjoyment while giving you more closure on the story.

The Best Way to Store Wallpapers: A Storage Solution for Your Collection
When it comes to storing pictures, Wallpapers is the best way to go. Not only are they easy and quick to access, but they can also be stored in a way that is convenient for you. Here are five tips on how to store wallpapers:
1) Choose the right size: When deciding how much wallpaper to store, it’s important to take into account the space you have and the type of wallpaper you’re interested in. If your wallspace is small, try choosing a smaller wallpaper rather than a large one.

2) Use media organizers: When organizing your wallpaper collection, using media organizers can make life so much easier. For example, if you keep all your photos on individual albums, then each album will have its own organizer.
